        <p>Thanks for using my extension. If you have any issues please <a href="https://github.com/jcreek/paladins-bounty-marketplace-chrome-extension/issues" target="_blank">report them on GitHub</a>. While you're there, why not consider giving the project a star?</p>
        <p>This extension is fan-made, open source and is not supported or endorsed by Hi-Rez Studios. I just wanted some features that weren't in the Marketplace site already so I added them myself with this extension.</p>
